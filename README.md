# Dissipative-Quantum-Field-Theory
This is an effort to bring Dissipative Quantum Field Theory based on Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics to the world in terms of theoretical aspects and stochastic simulation approaches. The main framework has been developed by Hans Christian Oettinger at ETH. We are going to use Sympy and Python for this purpose.
